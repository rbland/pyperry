class Base(object):
    """
    The Base class for all models using pyperry.

    L{Base} defines the functionality of a pyperry model.  All models should
    inherit (directly or indirectly) from L{Base}.  For a basic overview of
    usage, check out the docs on the L{pyperry} module.

    Configuration Overview
    ======================

    Configuration is done through various class methods on the model.  These
    could be set anywhere, but conventionally they are set in a C{config}
    method on the class.  This method is run when a class is created with the
    newly created class as an argument.  Thus, configuration can be done like
    this::

        class Animal(pyperry.base.Base):
            id = Field()
            name = Field(type=str)
            mammal = Field()

            reader = MyAdapter()

            friendships = HasMany(class_name="Friendship")
            friends = HasMany(class_name="Friend", through='friendships')

            mammal = Scope(where= { 'mammal': True })

    Any class configuration can be done in this method.

    Querying
    ========

    Queries can be built by chaining calls to scopes or query methods.  For
    example::

        Person.where(first_name='Bob').order('last_name')

    This generates a query for all Person objects with the first name "Bob"
    ordered by their last name.  Each query method returns a new L{Relation}
    object with the new query parameters applied.  This allows the continued
    chaining.

    A L{Relation} object is a sequence-like object behaving much like a
    C{list}.  The query will be run the first time the object is treated like a
    list, and the records will be used for the expression.  For example::

        query = Animal.where(type='Platypus')

        # Array comprehensions and for loops
        for animal in query:
            print animal.name + " is a platypus.  They don't do much."

        # Compares type and attributes of objects for equality
        object in query
        object not in query

        # Indexing, slicing, step slicing
        query[0]
        query[0:3]
        query[0:3:2]

        # Other
        len(query)

    In this example the query is executed before running the for loop, and all
    subsequent calls use that result.  Queries will not be run until you need
    them so unused queries don't hurt performance.  If you would like to force
    a query to run and retreive the records in a C{list} object use the
    L{Relation.all()} method, or to receive the object itself in single result
    queries use the L{Relation.first()} method.

    Persistence
    ===========

    Pyperry provides an interface for creating, updating, and deleting models
    when a write adapter is configured.  A model can be initialized as a "new"
    record (default) or a "stored" record and is determined by the
    C{new_record} attribute.  This changes the behavior of the save operation.
    A "new" record is created and a "stored" record is updated.  Also, a "new"
    record cannot be deleted as it does not yet exist in the database.  See the
    individual L{persistence methods<save>} for more information

    Scopes
    ======

    Scopes allow you to specify prebuilt views of your data.  Scopes, like
    query methods, can be applied simply by chaining calls on instances of
    L{Relation} or the L{Base} class.  Scopes are created by setting a class
    level attribute of type L{Scope}.  Here are some examples::

        ordered = Scope(order=['type', 'name'])
        platypus = Scope({ 'where': { 'type': 'platypus' } })
        perrys = Scope(lambda(cls): cls.where(name='perry'))

        @Scope
        def type_is(cls, name):
            return cls.where(type=name)

    These scopes can now be used in queries along with query methods and
    chained together to make powerful queries::


    Associations
    ============

    Associations allow you to define foreign key relationships between two
    models, the target (model on which the association is defined) and the
    source (model from which the data will come).  There are two basic kinds of
    associations:  has and belongs.  A has relationship means the foreign_key
    lives on the source model.  A belongs relationship means the foreign_key
    lives on the target model.

    Imagine a blog.  A blog has many articles and an article belongs to an
    author.  You might model this structure with Blog, Article and Person
    classes.  Associations are conventionally defined in the C{_config} method
    for each class, but to save space we'll just show the association
    definition for each class::

        class Blog(pyperry.base.Base):
            id = Field()

            articles = HasMany(class_name='Article')

        class Article(pyperry.base.Base):
            id = Field()
            blog_id = Field()
            author_id = Field()

            blog = BelongsTo(class_name='Blog', foreign_key='blog_id')
            author = BelongsTo(class_name='Person', foreign_key='author_id')

    Assuming you have an instance of C{Blog} called C{blog} you could then
    reference these associations like this::

        # An ordered list of articles on this blog
        articles = blog.authors().ordered()
        # The author of the first article
        articles[0].author()

    Note that the L{HasMany} association returns a L{Relation} object allowing
    you to apply query methods and scopes to the association before executing
    the query.

    For more information on Associations see the individual classes within the
    %L{pyperry.association} module
